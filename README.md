MAC-Automator-scripts
=====================

A few automator scripts to improve MAC workflow with PC users

10.8.x:
---------------------
Copy as UNC Path:  
Right click file/folder from a network share on a MAC, select 'Copy as UNC path', it converts it to the proper UNC path, and places it in your clipboard.  Allowing you to send a working link to PC users.  Great for PC/MACs shared enviroment.

Navigate to Path:  
On Outlook 2011 for Mac, allows you to select a UNC path, right click-> 'Navigate to Path', it will automatically map the network drive the UNC is associated with, and automatically open up to the folder path.

10.9.x:
---------------------
Copy as UNC Path:  
Same as above.

Navigate to Path:  
A lot was changed to get this working again, what a pain.

File Folder Copy UNC:  
Same as copy as UNC path, except if you run it on a file/folder it will also do the parent folder of that file/folder.

Email UNC Path:  
Same as file folder copy unc, however opens a new email with unc path in body.


I will add the actual workflows eventually.
